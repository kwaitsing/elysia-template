= Elysia With URN.ts Lite Version

== What is URN.ts Lite

The vanillan URN.ts is a framework which built upon ElysiaJS, Which is great.

But as the increasement of the elysia codebase, maintaing the URN.ts framework becomes extremely tricky.

To solve this issue, I decided to make URN.ts a library instead of a framework, including various tools and sockets for building a robust backend directly on elysiajs.

== How to init a project

1. Install bun from bun.sh
2. run `bunx urn-lite-spinup@latest <projectname>`, this will create a ready to use elysia codebase which has URN lite integrated.

== Structure intrudoction

Your app starts at `src/index`, this is the app entry point which means your codes start here.

> URN lite by default use MVC pattern for development

In the example alias, .ts is usually omitted because typescript would consider .ts as the default
